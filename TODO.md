# To-Do List
## Priority
- Saving edited chunks as files
- World creation UI (new / load / delete, seed, etc)
- New World Dir, subdir for each world 
- Colissions with world
- Placing / Deleting blocks 
- Add Windows Support (Probably just need to setup the build system)

## Graphics
- Shadow Mapping
- Radial blur god rays (Volumetric lighting)
- Ambient Occlusion
- Fix drawing order (transparent blocks last)
- Frustum culling (Currently rendering takes like 1% of frame time so don't worry)

## Really Low Priority
- Add more variety to world generation
- Chunk LOD (lower res for distant chunks 16x16 -> 8x8 -> 4x4 -> 2x2 -> 1x1)
- Use file walk and not hardcoded names for asset loading
- MULTIPLAYER :)
